üö¶ Application Performance Monitoring Dashboard
Tools Used: Power BI Service | SQL Server | DAX
üîç Overview
This case study highlights a BI solution built to monitor and optimize application/API performance in a production environment. The goal was to empower engineering and DevOps teams with real-time visibility into API usage patterns, performance metrics, and error trends, enabling proactive resolution of issues and long-term reliability improvements.
üß© Business Objective
‚¶Å	Monitor API call performance in real-time.
‚¶Å	Identify high-failure endpoints and performance bottlenecks.
‚¶Å	Track and improve system reliability via measurable KPIs.
‚¶Å	Support data-driven decisions to enhance customer experience.
üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture
1. Data Sources
‚¶Å	Data ingested from SQL Server, which captured API logs including response time, status codes, and payload metadata.
2. Data Modeling & Preparation
‚¶Å	Created fact tables for API calls and status logs.
‚¶Å	Power BI‚Äôs data model was optimized with calculated columns and relationships for performance trend analysis.
3. Key Metrics Tracked
‚¶Å	API Success Rate: % of successful responses (e.g., HTTP 200).
‚¶Å	Average Response Time: Tracked across endpoints and time windows.
‚¶Å	Failure Rate & Retry Analysis: Identified endpoints with frequent timeouts, 4xx/5xx errors.
‚¶Å	Request Volume Trends: To detect usage spikes or anomalies.
4. Visualizations & Features
‚¶Å	Dashboards with dynamic time filters and endpoint-level drill-downs.
‚¶Å	Trend analysis with rolling averages and cumulative DAX measures.
‚¶Å	Heatmaps for identifying performance issues by time of day or client type.
‚¶Å	KPI cards and threshold indicators for real-time alerts.
5. DAX and Automation
‚¶Å	Defined custom DAX measures to compute:
‚¶Å	Rolling error rates
‚¶Å	Monthly cumulative success trends
‚¶Å	Endpoint health scoring based on latency
‚¶Å	Enabled scheduled refreshes via Power BI Service for continuous data delivery.
üìà Impact & Results
‚¶Å	Uncovered underperforming endpoints, leading to code optimizations.
‚¶Å	Improved API reliability by 32.53% within 2 months.
‚¶Å	Enabled real-time visibility for DevOps, reducing mean time to detect (MTTD) and resolve (MTTR) issues.
‚¶Å	Replaced static performance reporting with a fully interactive and automated dashboard.
üîê Note
This case study is based on an implementation designed in a production environment. The datasets and business details have been anonymized to respect confidentiality. The focus here is to illustrate technical execution, performance monitoring strategy, and Power BI implementation patterns.
